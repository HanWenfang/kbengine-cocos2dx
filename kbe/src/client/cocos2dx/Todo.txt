This is my plan of port kbe packet for cocos2dx. The project is to develop a network framework wrapper of kbe. 
This project finally will be a library which can be used by cocos2dx. with this, you can do some thing under KBE Protocol.
Same with that famious mmorpg engine. 

1. Read KBE code . Setup a demo server. use unity client to track msg and confirm something.
2. Get the ported list , write some base utility class. MemoryStream, Bundle ,NetworkInterface , KBEngine singleton.
3. Port other debug helper class: 
    Dict Data Type Accessor , DebugInfo DebugError,
4. Do some small task.  
   eg: packet generate and decode. 
5. login connect test. (send login packet to kbe server. and check the response. parse packet and decode it) 

6. Q&A  
    How to forward or handle client method call?  
    How to find the correct inject place for our logic? 
    How to give kbeengine a chance to update? thread or only update ?
    various datatype convert : guid,char,uint8,float,xxxx string 

7.  KBReader,KBWriter KBMailbox,KBMessage,KBEntity,KBBundle UINT8 UINT16 UINT32 UINT64 
INT16 INT32 INT64 FLOAT DOUBLE STRING VECTOR PYTHON UNICODE MAILBOX BLOB ARRAY FIXED_DICT
